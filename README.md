# DistPP
Distributed programming project

This distributed algorithm must :

1. add 'A' label on the initial leader, and make it blink in Red/White
2. add 'B' label on the module which is the furthest agent from 'A' , and make it blink in Green/White
3. add 'C' label on the module which is the furthest agent from 'B' , and make it blink in Blue/White
4. add 'X' label on the module which is in the middle of B and C (verifying the condition expressed in the slides), and make it blink in Pink/White

Propose and test your code with several example of configurations (you will place these json files in your project)
